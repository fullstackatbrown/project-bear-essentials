## Description

This repository holds both the React Native mobile app and the backend API for the Brown Essentials app, maintained by [Full Stack at Brown](https://fullstackatbrown.com/). Dev setup information for each of the sub-projects are found in the `client/` and `server/` respectively.

Brown Essentials is a mobile app that exposes vital data and information about Brown University to its students. Currently, the app details dining halls and menus, laundry machines, an interactive map of the campus, and various other resources. It is currently in development, and will be released on both iOS and Android.
